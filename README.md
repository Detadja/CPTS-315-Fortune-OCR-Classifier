# CPTS-315-Fortune-OCR-Classifier

* This is a school project created in Python. It takes data from a file containing fortune cookie messages and classifies it based on future predictions or quotes of wisdom. It also then takes data from a file containing Optical Character Recognition data of handwritten characters and predicts what character the handwritten character is based on the handwritten image data. Then it outputs a txt file containing the number of mistakes for the former, and the accuracy of the OCR for the latter, over 20 iterations each.

* Last updated on: 19th Nov 2022, as Programming Assignment 3 for the course Cpts 315 - Introduction to Data Mining.

* This program was written in VS Code. To run, import files to local system and run on VS Code.
